  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Fly the World: Bird Flap</strong></p>
  <p>Last updated: August 21, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile game <strong>Fly the World: Bird Flap</strong> ("the Game", "we", "us", or "our") handles user information. This game is developed and published by an independent developer and is available for free on Google Play.</p>
  <p>We are committed to respecting your privacy. This policy explains what data may be collected, how it's used, and your choices.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not directly collect or store any personal data from users of the Game.</p>
  <p>However, the Game uses third-party services that may collect information automatically to enable advertising or usage measurement. These services operate under their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Game uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to serve advertisements, including banner ads and optional rewarded ads.</p>
  <p>AdMob may collect and process data such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (e.g., model, OS version)</li>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>Approximate location (for ad targeting)</li>
    <li>Usage statistics (e.g., ad views, interactions)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is collected automatically by AdMob, not by the developer of the Game.</p>
  <p>More on AdMob’s data practices: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></p>

  <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Game is intended for users aged 13 and older. It is not specifically directed toward children under 13 and does not contain any child-targeted content.</p>
  <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal data through the Game, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

  <h2>5. User Accounts and Input</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No login or account creation is required.</li>
    <li>No text input or nickname collection is used.</li>
    <li>Game progress is stored locally on the user’s device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>No personal data is stored by the developer on external servers.</p>
  <p>The Game does not upload gameplay data or device information to the developer.</p>
  <p>Any data collected by third-party services is handled and secured by those services.</p>

  <h2>7. Ads and Personalization</h2>
  <p>The Game displays banner ads and rewarded ads via Google AdMob.</p>
  <p>Ad content is controlled by Google’s ad network. Some ads may be personalized based on user behavior or location (as determined by AdMob).</p>
  <p>Users can manage ad personalization in their Google Account settings:<br>

  <h2>8. User Rights</h2>

  <p>Questions about AdMob’s data practices should be directed to Google.</p>
